     * describe. Imagine four points on a wheel; suppose in order to
     * to roll the wheel forward on the ground, you could only do so by
     * controlling which point is facing the ground. A smooth rotation
     * would always require you choose the point which is
     * counter-clockwise from the ground at a 90ยบ angle; and the point
     * which was on the ground, is now clockwise from the ground, at
     * 90ยบ. Going backwards is similar, except you choose the point
     * clockwise from the ground; and the point on the ground now goes
     * counter-clockwise.
     *
     * To advance the motor, you need to turn on an adjacent phase; if
     * phase 1 is on, turn on phase 2 and turn off phase 1; this allows
     * you to go "forward"; and then turn on phase 3, and turn off phase
     * 2; and you wrap around, so you turn on phase 0 and turn off phase
     * 3. And vice versa for going "backward". In this field, then, we
     * really care about only four bits; 0x1, 0x2, 0x4, and 0x8; and, in
     * particular, we care about the adjacent relations of those high
     * and low bits.
     *
     * It's really like if you unrolled the surface of the wheel and
     * laid it out as a flat line, but still with those points defined.
