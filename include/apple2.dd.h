     * controlling which point is facing the ground. A smooth rotation
     * would always require you choose the point which is
     * counter-clockwise from the ground at a 90ยบ angle; and the point
     * which was on the ground, is now clockwise from the ground, at
     * 90ยบ. Going backwards is similar, except you choose the point
     * clockwise from the ground; and the point on the ground now goes
     * counter-clockwise.

     * To advance the motor, you need to turn on an adjacent phase; if

     * 2; and you wrap around, so you turn on phase 0 and turn off phase
     * 3. And vice versa for going "backward". In this field, then, we

     * particular, we care about the adjacent relations of those high
